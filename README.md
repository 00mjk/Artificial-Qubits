# artificial-qubits

Hello, Welcome to my Quantum Experience with JavaScript.

I am using the p5.js library (p5js.org for more info)

This program was created to mimic an actual Quantum computer. Keep in mind that this was not made exactly like real Quantum computer. So I had to make a lot of adjustments to create a similar replica. 

Thank you
